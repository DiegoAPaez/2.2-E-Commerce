![Technologie Icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,bootstrap,js,babel "Technologie Icons")

***Babel*** is essential for using JavaScript modules as it transpiles modern JavaScript syntax (like ES modules) into backward-compatible versions, allowing you to write code with import/export statements that works across browsers including older ones that don't natively support ES modules.
